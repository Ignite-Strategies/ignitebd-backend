# IgniteBD Architecture (Merged)

The detailed backend architecture documentation now lives inside the consolidated stack guide:
- `Ignite-frontend-production/Ignitebd_stack_devguide.md`
- `Ignite-frontend-production/docs/dealpipeline.md` (Deal Pipeline data flow and UI contract)

Refer to that file for tenant boundaries, schema structure, route architecture, and onboarding flows. This legacy filename is retained to avoid broken references.
