USER INPUT:
- Name: ${assessmentData.name}
- Company: ${assessmentData.company}
- Work Too Much: ${assessmentData.workTooMuch}
- Assign Tasks: ${assessmentData.assignTasks}
- Want More Clients: ${assessmentData.wantMoreClients}
- Revenue Growth Target: ${assessmentData.revenueGrowthPercent}%
- Total Volume Target: $${assessmentData.totalVolume?.toLocaleString() || 'Not specified'}
- BD Spend: $${assessmentData.bdSpend?.toLocaleString() || 'Not specified'}

ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Relate with the user by acknowledging their feelings and goals
2. Repeat back what they want (more clients, growth targets)
3. Identify what they need (more BD, systematic approach)
4. Keep this standard since this is a funnel for our business
5. Prepare them for a deeper dive once they become a client

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
{
  "igniteGrowthAssessment": "Ignite Growth Assessment",
  "relateWithUser": "It sounds like you are feeling [their workload situation] and want [their growth goals] - repeat back their specific goals",
  "growthNeeds": "To get there, you need [more BD spend/activities] and a systematic approach to [specific areas they need help with]",
  "deeperDive": "This assessment shows the foundation for a deeper dive into your specific growth strategy once you become a client",
  "nextSteps": "Ready to take the next step in your growth journey?"
}

Keep the tone professional, relatable, and encouraging. Focus on acknowledging their current state and connecting their goals to what they need for systematic growth.`;
