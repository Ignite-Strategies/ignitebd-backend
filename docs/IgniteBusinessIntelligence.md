# Ignite BusinessIntelligence: Aligning Product Value with Market Personas

## Premise

We want to target people based on what we believe is our core product — or reverse-engineer our products to the people we most want to serve. Over time, both evolve as we collect real-world feedback.

## Core Idea

Ignite BD uses BusinessIntelligence as the engine that keeps strategy adaptive:

- **Products** define our promise and differentiator.
- **Personas** express market archetypes — goals, pain points, and desired outcomes.
- **Value Prop Alignment** bridges both sides, showing where messaging and offering intersect.

## Scoring & Feedback

- Each persona can be linked to one or more products.
- The `alignmentScore` quantifies resonance between our internal product value prop and what matters most to that persona.
- Over time, as we record real interactions and campaign outcomes, this score evolves — guiding BD teams toward the highest-yield personas and informing product refinements.

## Example

- **Product**: “Ignite CRM Automation” — `valueProp`: “Turn follow-ups into closed deals automatically.”
- **Persona**: “Solo Consultant” — `valuePropToPersona`: “Simplify client management without hiring an assistant.”
- **AlignmentScore**: 87 → strong resonance.

## Future Layer

This structure lays groundwork for:

- Auto-matching campaigns to persona/product pairs.
- Smart outreach templates personalized by value prop match.
- Data visualizations of product-persona resonance over time.
